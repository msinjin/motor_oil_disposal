## Motor Oil Disposal Ottawa

The City of Ottawa provides a list of ["Take it back!" members](http://app06.ottawa.ca/online_services/recycling/items/371_en.html) who accept used motor oil for reuse, recycling or proper disposal. 

This project provides an interactive map interface to find these member locations. It works by:

1. Web-scraping The City's list,
2. Geolocating member addresses in the list, and
3. Plotting results with [leaflet](https://leafletjs.com)

### Usage

The interactive map can be found here:
